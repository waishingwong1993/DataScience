# Analysis

Analysis.ipynb is a file dedicated to project 2 of STAT9760 FALL 2020 at Baruch College. It aims to use a combination of Spark & Python to analyze ~10 GB of Yelp data from Kaggle. 

Some tasks that we wish to tackle are:
1. Understand how to set up PySpark on AWS
2. Basic data manipulation with PySpark such as groupbys, and joins
3. Answer 'are Yelp reviews skew negative?'.
4. Answer 'should Elites be trusted?'.
